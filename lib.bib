	The term search-based procedural content generation is proposed as

	A taxonomy for procedural content generation is devised, centering
	on what kind of content is generated, how the content is represented
	and how the quality/fitness of the content is evaluated; search-based
	procedural content generation in particular is situated within this
	taxonomy. This article also contains a survey of all published papers
	known to the authors in which game content is generated through search
	or optimisation, and ends with an overview of important open research
	problems.},

  abstract = {Procedural content generation (PCG) is an increasingly important area
	of technology within modern human-computer interaction (HCI) design.
	Personalization of user experience via affective and cognitive modeling,
	coupled with real-time adjustment of the content according to user
	needs and preferences are important steps towards effective and meaningful
	PCG. Games, Web 2.0, interface and software design are amongst the
	most popular applications of automated content generation. The paper
	provides a taxonomy of PCG algorithms and introduces a framework
	for PCG driven by computational models of user experience. This approach,
	which we call Experience-Driven Procedural Content Generation (EDPCG),
	is generic and applicable to various sub-areas of HCI. We employ
	games as an indicative example of rich HCI and complex affect elicitation,
	and demonstrate the approach's effectiveness via dissimilar successful
	studies.},
